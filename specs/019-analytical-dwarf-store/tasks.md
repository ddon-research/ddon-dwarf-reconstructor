# Tasks

- [x] Establish goal contracts and authority matrix.
- [x] Add typed analytical records and query/materialization ports.
- [x] Implement one-pass typed Parquet/raw-section publication with opt-in JSONL audit output.
- [x] Add opt-in CU-boundary checkpoint snapshots with explicit incomplete-query semantics.
- [x] Emit typed range, location, line, macro, frame, abbreviation, and name families during the same CU pass.
- [x] Implement manifest validation and source binding.
- [x] Add direct Parquet writers/readers.
- [x] Align JSONL-to-Parquet backfill with the bounded direct writer and manifest layout policy.
- [x] Review the local PyArrow 25 reference and record schema, Dataset, row-group, and memory
  boundaries.
- [x] Add Doris Compose and native loading/evidence plans.
- [x] Add benchmark protocol and report schema.
- [x] Migrate generation and knowledge export to the store.
- [x] Retire normal legacy lookup paths after parity boundary; retain legacy adapters only for explicit validation.
- [ ] Run focused, repository, real-asset, and environmental validation.

## Status notes

Current boundary (2026-08-08): the promoted durable v1.1 store is
`output/analytical-dwarf/main/store-4236f598acc8f158`; native Doris is the active backend, while
versioned Temp stores, versioned Doris databases, and Iceberg measurements below are historical
evidence only. The full season-two run is still in progress, and standalone bundle, approved MSVC,
IDA, and Sonar acceptance remain separate gates.

The implementation and deterministic/direct-storage fixture slice is complete. The v27 real-ELF
run now supplies the complete source-bound Parquet manifest, independent payload validation,
exact native Doris load/count parity, finished statistics, tablet inspection, and ordered native
query parity. The classifier-backed knowledge export is also complete and internally
matches the generated header after the documented include-guard normalization. LLVM UCRT64
verification remains non-clean and is retained as additive diagnostics; it does not authorize
discarding rows. An explicit single-symbol live pyelftools baseline is now observed with a
source-bound 180-second bound; a second fresh store-backed generation also reproduces the exact
current header hash. The remaining acceptance work is recovery of the approved historical real
`rLayout.h` baseline and the complete 110%-of-baseline p95/peak-memory comparison. The generic
full-store file query harness timed out because it rescans fact families per query; this is a
harness limitation, while native Doris is the required serving backend for the measured corpus.
Checkpoints remain diagnostic snapshots only; their real-asset overhead remains unmeasured. These
items are not marked complete from source inspection, a dry-run plan, or partial files.
